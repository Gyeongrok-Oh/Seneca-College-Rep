I think I have successfully defined it as non-reflective sections of logic. In order to achieve this, 
I could not use the same code over and over again, but rather write the code easier to read and maintain so that I could call it up or reuse it when I wanted to.


Structures provide a practical means of combining related data into a unified unit, simplifying programming tasks by reducing the amount of code necessary 
and enabling straightforward organization and manipulation of data. If structures were not used, we would have to pass every individual piece of data to the function separately, 
resulting in a much more complex and cumbersome process.


do {
      while (flag == 1) {
         do {

                if (move < 1 || move > game.pathLength) {

                }
                else {

                }
            } while (move < 1 || move > game.pathLength);

   } while (!(player.numberOfLive == 0 || game.numberOfMove == 0) || flag == 0);
