 Floats do not guarantee exact representation. When a binary representation of the decimal is not possible, it will, under the hood, 
find a similar value that is easier represented in the floating point system and use it.
If 17.95 is expressed as a floating point, the Float at mantissa can be strangely expressed as 23 bits, or only 23 bits can be printed.



we can see the cocerion in first question, money is Int and 100.0 is double so the compiler would print out double 
second one which we can see implicit that is as the computer intended, it means that The computer casts itself.
The third problem is that we can also see promotions, which means that computers promote to a larger data type if they calculate the number of numbers. 
And we're going to do what we're going to do and we explicit before we run the program

we can see the casting of all these questions because it can be changed the data type and also it could promotion if question, the data type will be promoted, 
and if the data is a print statement, the computer will change the data this is an Implicit and before we print out something, we can explicit the data type ourselves
And finally, because of the truncation, the output of question 1 and output 3 appear differently, and the number of bytes we can write is limited, so the computer is not accurate.
