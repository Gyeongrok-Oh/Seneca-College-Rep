The code is more systematic and efficient by using variables and macros instead of hard-coded constant literals. 
This approach adds meaning to value and simplifies updates, providing improved maintenance. The exact value can be used multiple times, increasing reuse. 
Variables and macros can also give the deal a precise name, reducing the likelihood of errors.







We find the average at the end and show the print statement. 
The reason for this is that the For loop itself executes a code with Curly Brace, 
and it will not produce the result value we want on the spot, 
and the code itself will increase acceleration and reduce compilation time and space, which will be wrong.
