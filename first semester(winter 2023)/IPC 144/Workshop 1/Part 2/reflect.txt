1. C is a second language at me and my first language is a python becasue it is comfortable when I write the code and It is the second language, 
but I think C is fast and does not have a high entry barrier among languages, 
so it is good to learn and it is excellent for learning other languages.

2.  I think there are four steps by step. First, you create a source file, as you did in VS, and then the C compiler compiles it. 
Now, compilation turns the code that humans write into the code that machines write, and then you run the next file and you learn. 
I'll get the last result.

3. long story short, I want to be a master in C language and also Linux or Unix so I can manage my file in my mind, and I learn and memorize all of the codes 
so I have to complete my work more easily and I would like to write my code comfortably when other people see it 
and have many projects and complete it successfully and go to a Google or Microsoft, 
or Apple developer and teach folks that want to learn to me about how to coding.
