I used the function to call the string library and know the number of strings. Modify the code or testing environment to capture the program's output, including prompts and error messages. Create test cases where blank lines are entered as customer information. Run the modified code or testing environment with the test cases and capture the output. Compare the captured output against the expected prompts for blank lines. Manually verify if the prompts displayed in the output match the expected prompts. You can test whether the correct prompts are produced by capturing the program's output and comparing it with the desired prompts. This process allows you to verify the program's behavior and ensure that it handles blank lines appropriately by issuing the correct prompts or error messages
