      <h3>What is BTS?</h3>
      <p>
        BTS is a seven-member group composed of Jin, Suga, J-Hope, RM, Jimin, V, and Jungkook. They
        debuted 2013 under Big Hit Entertainment with the single album 2 Cool 4 Skool. Their name
        stands for Bangtan Sonyeondan, which means Bulletproof Boy Scouts in Korean. They later
        adopted the English name Beyond the Scene to signify their growth and ambition. BTS is known
        for their diverse musical style, which incorporates hip-hop, pop, R&B, EDM, and more
        elements. They are also known for their self-produced and co-written songs, often addressing
        mental health, youth issues, self-love, individualism, and social justice. They have also
        drawn inspiration from literature, philosophy, and psychology in their discography and
        adjacent work, such as their alternate universe storyline. BTS has achieved unprecedented
        success both in South Korea and internationally. They have sold over 40 million albums in
        South Korea alone, making them the best-selling artist in the country’s history1. They have
        also topped the charts in many countries around the world, including the US, where they
        became the first Korean act to reach the number one on both the Billboard Hot 100 and
        Billboard Global 200 with their Grammy-nominated single “Dynamite”2 They have also won

      <h3>What is K-pop?</h3>
      <p>
        K-pop is a term that refers to Korean popular music, which encompasses a variety of genres
        and styles. K-pop emerged in the 1990s as a result of the globalization and democratization
        of South Korea after its military dictatorship. K-pop artists often undergo rigorous
        training and auditioning before debuting under entertainment agencies that manage their
        careers and image. K-pop is characterized by its high production value, catchy melodies,
        synchronized dance moves, elaborate stage shows, and appealing visuals. K-pop songs are
        usually sung in Korean with some English or other languages mixed in. K-pop groups often
        have a leader, a leading vocalist, a prominent dancer, a prominent rapper, and other roles
        that showcase their talents and personalities. K-pop has become a global phenomenon in
        recent years thanks to its widespread online presence and fan engagement. K-pop fans are
        known for their loyalty and enthusiasm, creating fan clubs, fan art, fan fiction, fan
        chants, and projects to support their favourite artists. K-pop fans also use social media
        platforms such as YouTube, Twitter, Instagram, TikTok, and reverse to stream music videos,
        follow updates, interact with idols, and spread awareness.

        tackled various themes and issues that resonate with their fans, such as mental health,

        Hermann Hesse’s Demian, Carl Jung’s Map of the Soul, and more. Their authentic and
        charismatic personalities: BTS has shown their genuine selves to their fans through various
        platforms, such as reality shows, documentaries, live broadcasts, podcasts, and social media
