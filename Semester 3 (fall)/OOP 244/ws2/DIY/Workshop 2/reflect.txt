1. C is a second language I learned. It has easy debugging and low cost, and even the cost is low, and It is faster to complete than other languages.
From what I have learned, it has been used extensively in OS. When other people see this C code, they can understand it clearly and obviously, and if I learn the program C, 
I could use a bunch of other languages I can use easily.        

2.  It is practical, and I do not know that I did not even know I could send a file like this. Moreover, I understand a little. I am so happy to learn about the Linux command line, 
so I do not need to click file explorer and check the list of files or documents more quickly if I memorize all of the code. Filezilla is also an exemplary aspect of security
when we send a file exactly

3. long story short, I want to be a master in C language and also Linux or Unix so I can manage my file in my mind, and I learn and memorize all of the codes so I have to complete my work more easily
and I would like to write my code comfortably when other people see it and have many projects and complete it successfully and go to a Google or Microsoft, or Apple developer and 
teach folks that want to learn to me about how to coding
