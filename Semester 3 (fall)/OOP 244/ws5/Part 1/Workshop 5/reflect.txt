During this workshop, I explored various aspects of operator overloading in C++. These included creating custom binary member operators, which allow us to define specific behaviours for operations like addition, subtraction, and comparison between class objects.
I also delved into the world of custom unary operators, such as increment and decrement, where I learned to fine-tune the behaviour of class objects when these operators are applied.
Additionally, the workshop covered the creation of helper operators to facilitate smooth interactions between custom classes and primitive data types, enhancing the user-friendliness and efficiency of the code.
One key takeaway was realizing the significance of operator overloading in C++ for making code more expressive and understandable. Armed with this knowledge, I now have the skills to implement tailored operators that cater to the unique needs of my classes. This workshop has been a valuable learning experience, and I'm eager to apply these concepts in my future C++ programming endeavours.
