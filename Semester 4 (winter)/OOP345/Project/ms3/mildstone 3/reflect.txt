Organization and Structure:
The project is organized into multiple header and source files, which helps in maintaining and understanding the codebase.
Each class (CustomerOrder, LineManager, Station, Utilities, and Workstation) is implemented in separate files, promoting modularity and encapsulation.
The use of namespaces (seneca) helps prevent naming conflicts and improves code readability.

Memory Management:
Memory allocation and deallocation are handled appropriately, using dynamic memory allocation (new) and resource management (delete).
There's proper handling of move semantics (move) in the move constructor and move assignment operator of the CustomerOrder class, which can improve performance and resource utilization.

Exception Handling:
Exception handling is used in some parts of the code, such as file input handling in the LineManager constructor and token extraction in the Utilities class.
However, the usage of exception handling could be improved by providing more informative error messages and catching specific exceptions rather than generic strings.

Code Readability and Maintainability:
Descriptive variable names and function names contribute to the readability of the code.
Proper indentation and spacing enhance code readability.
Comments are provided at the beginning of each file, specifying author information, completion date, and confirmation of authorship, which is a good practice for code attribution and accountability.

Algorithm Efficiency:
Algorithms like std::for_each and std::all_of are used effectively to iterate over containers and perform operations on elements, improving code readability and maintainability.
However, some algorithms, such as linear search in the LineManager constructor to find matching stations, could potentially be optimized for performance, especially if the number of stations is large.

Design Patterns and Object-Oriented Principles:
The code demonstrates object-oriented principles like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
The implementation of the Station, Workstation, and CustomerOrder classes reflects the concept of object composition, where smaller objects are combined to create more complex ones.
